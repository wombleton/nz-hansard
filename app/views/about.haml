      %p= %Q[TheyWorkForYou.co.nz derives its inspiration from the people behind <a href="http://theyworkforyou.com/">TheyWorkForYou.com</a> and <a href="http://www.publicwhip.org.uk/">The Public Whip</a>, which are simliar sites for the UK, and from people who work with <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/">mySociety.org</a>. Specific inspiration has come from the determination and insight of Julian, whose latest project <a href="http://undemocracy.com/">UNdemocracy.com</a> is possibly the sole source of addressable transcripts of United Nations Security Council and General Assembly meetings on the Web.]
